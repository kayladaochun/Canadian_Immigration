# Canadian_Immigration
Analyzing the numbers of invitations for Canadian immigrants in the last couple of years

--First I want to have an understand what this table includes

SELECT *
FROM Canada_Immigration

--Let's take a look at the data narrowing down the important columns and be sure that the immigration programs does not have have missing values

SELECT 
	date, 
	immigration_program,
	programs_covered,
	Invitations_issued,
	year
FROM Canada_Immigration
WHERE immigration_program is not null
ORDER BY year DESC

--I want to know the total of invitations issued for each program but there are some invitations where it does not specifty what type of program so I will be excluding that.

SELECT 
	immigration_program, 
	SUM(invitations_issued) as total_invitations, 
	year
FROM Canada_Immigration
WHERE Immigration_program NOT LIKE '%No%'
GROUP BY 
	immigration_program, 
	year
ORDER BY total_invitations DESC

--Looks like the Canadian Experience Class has the most invitations compared to the other programs
--Find out average lowest CRS score invited between 2020 and 2021 between immigration programs
SELECT 
	CAST(AVG(CRS_score_of_lowest_ranked_candidate_invited) AS INT) AS avg_lowest_score,
	immigration_program,
	year,
	invitations_issued
FROM Canada_Immigration
WHERE year between 2020 and 2021 
GROUP BY Immigration_program, year, invitations_issued
ORDER BY year DESC

--Let's filter down to just Federal Skill Trades program for 2020-2021
SELECT 
	CAST(AVG(CRS_score_of_lowest_ranked_candidate_invited) AS INT) AS avg_lowest_score,
	immigration_program,
	year,
	invitations_issued
FROM Canada_Immigration
WHERE year between 2020 and 2021 AND Immigration_program LIKE '%federal%'
GROUP BY Immigration_program, year, invitations_issued
ORDER BY year DESC
	
--Now I would like to know the min and max of the lowest CRS scores that received an invitation for immigration through the Federal Skilled Trades program
SELECT 
	MIN(CRS_score_of_lowest_ranked_candidate_invited) AS min_lowest_score,
	MAX(CRS_score_of_lowest_ranked_candidate_invited) AS max_lowest_score,
	immigration_program,
	year,
	invitations_issued
FROM Canada_Immigration
WHERE year between 2020 and 2021 and Immigration_program LIKE '%Federal%'
GROUP BY Immigration_program, year, invitations_issued
ORDER BY year DESC
	
--That's strange, it says the min and max lowest CRS scores are 415 so I want to dig a bit more and see if there was a different from 2019-2020.
--Find min and max of the 250 invitation of Federal Skill Trades program from 2019-2020

SELECT 
	MIN(CRS_score_of_lowest_ranked_candidate_invited) AS min_lowest_score,
	MAX(CRS_score_of_lowest_ranked_candidate_invited) AS max_lowest_score,
	immigration_program,
	year,
	invitations_issued
FROM Canada_Immigration
WHERE year between 2019 and 2021 and Immigration_program LIKE '%Federal%'
GROUP BY Immigration_program, year, invitations_issued
ORDER BY year DESC

-- The previous query tells me that the min and max of lowest CRS scores that were invited to the Federal Skilled Trades program were significantly lower in 2020 than 2019. I'm sure the pandemic had something to do with those numbers.
